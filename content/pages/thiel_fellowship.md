1. How did you hear about the fellowship?
   1. Jake Adler
2. What is your country of residence?
   1. United States
3. What is your city of residence?
   1. San Fransisco
4. Is this your hometown?
   - [ ] Yes
   - [x] No
5. What is your education status?
   1. Never started college. Pursued startup instead.
6. Were you homeschooled?
   - [ ] Yes
   - [x] No
7. What are you working on now?
   1. My mission is to seed life in the universe via von Neumann probes. Life is the only force in the universe that combats entropy. Making complexity in the galaxy default-alive will be a a fundamental shift in the universal order. I have what I lovingly call my eightfold path to get there, a series of productizeable technologies to get there, starting with asteroid mining using a new fundamentally more scaleable architecture than other attempts. In the moderate case, it will enable outcompeting terrestrial mining operations and reduce the price of our most valuable minerals (PGMs namely) by up to 2x in the first decade, enabling new a wealth of downstream opportunities globally, and of course making the pioneering organization proportionally valuable.
8. What industry would you categorize your company/project in?
   1. Space industrialization
9. Project/company link?
   1. https://khanspaceindustries.com
10. Additional files
    - Attach a deck or any additional materials that help describe what you’re up to. (4 MB max)
11. Do you have any eligible cofounders?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [x] No
12. What cool stuff have you worked on in the past?
    - P2P messaging [system](https://github.com/djmango/pyddle) (slow tbh)
    - A ton of pre-transformer self-learning [chatbots](https://github.com/djmango/the-benjamin-project) (didn't work)
    - Global top 1% [game-playing robots](https://github.com/djmango/korvex) (this was pretty fun)
    - [Self-driving cars](https://youtu.be/pLDMhNwsbwI?si=olO68hEVxFpDS1t4) trained in simulation (unsafe)
    - [FPV drones](https://youtu.be/b7MsTlukhV8?si=NmKNjW-uj_2dV5ZC) (fast)
    - ML [document processing and problem extraction](https://getonder.com) (pretty cool)
    - [AI B2B SaaS Coursera competitor](https://jeeny.ai) (fired)
    - [AI transcription/translation platform](https://swiftink.io) (acquired)
    - [Neuralink compression challenge](https://github.com/djmango/smallbrain) (sota)
    - [A ton of open-source stuff](https://github.com/djmango/obsidian-transcription) (free as in beer)
    - [LLMs integrated into OS](https://i.inc) (sleek)
    - [SF2 deep tech hackerhouse](https://sf2.sh) (active)
    - Designed & built liquid-fueled [rocket engine](https://x.com/sulaimanghori/status/1861261036407661046) (loud)
    - [Asteroid mining](https://khanspaceindustries.com) (ambitious)
13. What is the most important problem facing your field?
    1. Fear. Risk tolerance has gone down considerably. You too, have felt this. In some ways this is a positive sign, indicating the increased value of a life and reduced effort required to achieve comfort and safety. However, neither safety nor comfort are life's raison d'etre. Our purpose is to grow past the bounds of those before us. Colonizing space is risky, but this must not demerit the pursuit.
14. What is the most important problem facing someone else’s field?
    1. Wether or not you believe in a near-term super-intelligence horizon, it is clear that the pool of capabilities unique to humans is shrinking. In order to survive as a species, we must evolve. BCIs appear to be the most direct solution.
15. What are you currently obsessed with that is totally unrelated to your project?
    1. Material science. Specifically polymers. I find it extremely alluring how elementary properties, when harnessed effectively, can be made extremely practical. Most material manufacturing processes boil down to mix with this, heat to here, apply pressure in this way, and you have your solution. It's curious that the principle is simple, yet the details make the undertaking balloon out.
16. How do you feel about money?
    1. Value store. Means to an end. Its purpose is to buy people's time, loyalty, and work output.
17. What are you scared of?
    1. Regret. As far as I'm aware, we have one shot. Any and all stumbles do cost us, even if marginally so. With projects of great stature, the significance of any error scales exponentially with time. We have many truisms to placate ourselves from these fears, but the universe is not fooled.
18. Tell us something tangible you want.
    1. A garage. I like tinkering, have many long-form projects I undertake and require physical space and tooling.
