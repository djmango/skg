1. Are you technical?
	  1. Yes
2. Have you previously applied to Z Fellows?
	  1. Yes
3. Are you in school or working? Or both? Where at?
	  1. Working full time on Khan Space Industries
4. What is the project you are currently working on or want to pursue?
	  1. My mission is to seed life in the universe via von Neumann probes. Life is the only force in the universe that combats entropy. Making complexity in the galaxy default-alive will be a a fundamental shift in the universal order. I have an eightfold path to get there, a series of productizeable technologies, starting with asteroid mining. I'm developing a fundamentally more scaleable architecture than other asteroid mining attempts. In the moderate case, it enable outcompete terrestrial mining operations and reduce the price of our most valuable minerals (platinum group metals namely) by at minimum half in just the first decade.
5. What problem are you solving?
	  1. Life having a single point of failure.
6. What expertise do you have to execute your work?
	  1. My whole life I've been solving multifaceted engineering problems and building orgs with limited resources.
7. Who are your competitors, and what do you understand that they don't?
	1. Astroforge: Developing from technology level 1 or 2 all the way to 9 for a commercial project decreases probability of success significantly. Their betting on developing a novel 0g mining and refining system. A redirect approach is significantly simpler, and NASA ARM has already brought many of the technologies into high TRLs.
	2. DSI & Planetary Resources (defunct): Budget for failure. Space is not tolerant, and what would be a minor failure on earth often terminates space missions. There will be oversights and allowing for single mission failures to bankrupt your company is not a winning strategy.
8. What have you worked on in the past?
	   - P2P messaging [system](https://github.com/djmango/pyddle) (slow tbh)
    - A ton of pre-transformer self-learning [chatbots](https://github.com/djmango/the-benjamin-project) (didn't work)
    - Global top 1% [game-playing robots](https://github.com/djmango/korvex) (this was pretty fun)
    - [Self-driving cars](https://youtu.be/pLDMhNwsbwI?si=olO68hEVxFpDS1t4) trained in simulation (unsafe)
    - [FPV drones](https://youtu.be/b7MsTlukhV8?si=NmKNjW-uj_2dV5ZC) (fast)
    - ML [document processing and problem extraction](https://getonder.com) (pretty cool)
    - [AI B2B SaaS Coursera competitor](https://jeeny.ai) (fired)
    - [AI transcription/translation platform](https://swiftink.io) (acquired)
    - [Neuralink compression challenge](https://github.com/djmango/smallbrain) (sota)
    - [A ton of open-source stuff](https://github.com/djmango/obsidian-transcription) (free as in beer)
    - [LLMs integrated into OS](https://i.inc) (sleek)
    - [SF2 deep tech hackerhouse](https://sf2.sh) (active)
    - Designed & built liquid-fueled [rocket engine](https://x.com/sulaimanghori/status/1861261036407661046) (loud)
9. What's the nerdiest thing about you?
	1. My default thought is "how does it work?". Some of my earliest memories are being obsessed with car engines and vacuums because their mechanisms were mysteries to me and I couldn't live with that. Many times in daily life even today I notice when I can't explain to myself in simple terms how something works or came to be I drop what I'm doing and satisfy my curiosity.
10. What drives you?
	1. I have a very clear and specific vision for the future and I don't believe anyone else will direct it to occur. Thus I must ensure that outcome.
11. What non-traditional things were you doing growing up?
    1. In middle school I was captivated by the idea of additive manufacturing and 3d printers, these were the early days. The fidget spinner craze started so I ordered parts from China and built a RepRap clone, 1k skateboard bearings, and started a fab in my bedroom. At night every two hours I'd wake up, clear the print bed and start the next one, in the morning before school spray painting and assembling the batch for the day, run to the bus stops of other schools, distribute to my resellers (other kids) there, sell at school all day, and going home, collect my profits, give commissions, and from continue manufacturing. I ended up getting in a huge mess with the school as a result which indeed aided in my radicalization against institutions.
12. Describe a risk or challenge you've faced.
	13. I always planned to jump straight into building companies instead of going go a university. To this end, I graduated highschool early and began working in startups immediately to the chagrin of my family and friends. I had no plan B if this did not work, I didn't apply anywhere nor a job lined up when I decided to do this. Simply began building. Along the way, I've had instances where I measured runway in weeks instead of years, worked past mental breaks (they don't exist) and in more than one case have gone against the advice of literally everyone I knew.
13. Personal and/or Project Website and/or Links about you
	1. https://skg.gg
14. List or describe any achievements and prizes.
	1. Virginia innovation challenge winner 2015.
	2. Competitive robotics regional champion 5x and virginia champion 2x 2015-2020.
	3. Graduated hs early, only one in my class, thus valedictorian
	4. Built and led technical teams at 3 startups before starting my own
15. Who would you co-found a company with if you could pick anyone in your network
	1. Alex Koch
