+++

1. **January: Advisor Alignment & Requirements**
	 - Finalize advisor commitments (electric propulsion, orbital & deep space mission experts).
	 - Conduct trade studies on power generation (solar setup, transformers).
	 - Explore NASA/DARPA/DoD grants; draft pitch materials for funding.
2. **February: Feasibility & System Architecture**
	 - Define ion thruster and 200 kW power system specs (thrust, ISP, mass, solar surface area, deployment method)
	 - Begin preliminary thermal/structural analyses for thruster and power.
	 - Refine asteroid capture/return concept (burn times, trajectories, targets).
	 - Pursue selected grants and continue investor relationship building.
	 - Gather letters of support from advisors and potential partners.
3. **March: Detailed Design & Partner Engagement**
     - Finalize power distribution and thruster control systems using simulation.
     - Identify suppliers for critical components (cathodes, high-voltage hardware).
     - Establish partners, NDAs + agreements for subsystems not built in-house.
     - Attend & host industry roundtables to expand network in high-power electric propulsion, deep-space missions.
4. **April: Lab Setup & Preliminary Mission Architecture**
     - Finalize lab facility (vacuum chamber, safety protocols).
     - Onboard engineering hires (propulsion, power electronics).
     - Draft comms specs (bandwidth, ground stations) and refine capture timeline.
     - Outline return trajectory (direct reentry vs. Earth-orbit processing).
     - Engage government partners (e.g., Australia) for landing rights.
     - Explore private sector interest in partial asteroid ownership or presales.
5. **May: Full Mission Architecture & Alternative Revenue Streams**
     - Finalize comms frequencies, data rates, and ground ops procedures.
     - Implement backup options (relay sats, global tracking networks).
     - Establish specs for capture mechanism, sensors, and reentry (or LEO) approach.
     - Compare cost/risk of direct atmospheric entry vs. in-orbit processing.
     - Evaluate selling asteroid “shares” to hedge risk, similar to traditional mining industry financing.
     - Investigate on-orbit materials processing as a secondary revenue source.
     - Prepare 12–18 month plan for launch/demonstration and flight qualification.
6. **June: Reentry Collaboration & Fiscal Resources**
     - Negotiate agreements with Australia (or other countries) for reentry zones.
     - Address legal/regulatory pathways for extraterrestrial materials.
     - Finalize capture timeline, primary & backup comms, and return milestones.
     - Develop risk-mitigation strategies for each mission phase.
     - Enter seed round, mid-sized contracts both govt and private to diversify fiscal supply line.
