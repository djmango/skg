Sulaiman Khan Ghori

I am an engineer.

Some things about me:

- Located in Mission, San Francisco
- Robotics & ML background
- Been doing startups since 2019
- I love space
- You can [fork](https://github.com/djmango/skg) this website
- Ideally, I'd like to die on a generation ship.

Some things I've worked on:

- P2P messaging [system](https://github.com/djmango/pyddle) (slow tbh)
- A ton of pre-transformer self-learning [chatbots](https://github.com/djmango/the-benjamin-project) (didn't work)
- Global top 1% [game-playing robots](https://github.com/djmango/korvex) (this was pretty fun)
- [Self-driving cars](https://youtu.be/pLDMhNwsbwI?si=olO68hEVxFpDS1t4) trained in simulation (unsafe)
- [FPV drones](https://youtu.be/b7MsTlukhV8?si=NmKNjW-uj_2dV5ZC) (fast)
- ML [document processing and problem extraction](https://getonder.com) (pretty cool)
- [My vim config](https://vim.skg.bio) (time sink)
- [AI B2B SaaS Coursera competitor](https://jeeny.ai) (fired)
- [AI transcription/translation platform](https://swiftink.io) (acquired)
- [Neuralink compression challenge](https://github.com/djmango/smallbrain) (sota)
- [A ton of open-source stuff](https://github.com/djmango/obsidian-transcription) (free as in beer)
- [LLMs integrated into OS](https://i.inc) (active)
- Designing & building liquid-fueled [rocket engine](https://rocket.skg.bio) (active)

My long term ambition is to build Von Neumann machines to seed life on other planets. I am currently 3% of the way there.
